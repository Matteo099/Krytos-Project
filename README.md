# Krytos-Project
Krytos Project is an immersive 2D MMORPG game that takes inspiration from Metin2. 
Set in a fantastical world, players embark on an epic journey to explore vast landscapes, battle fierce monsters, and interact with a vibrant community of players.

## About the project
The project was developed using Nodejs, HTML5, Express.js, MongoJS, and Socket.io libraries, and it provides both client and server files.

Please note that the project is no more in development (it was developed when I was 17 years old :D), it is not complete and I do not assume any responsibility for any bugs or issues that may arise.

## Requirements
In order to run the game you need:

- Node js
- npm
- MongoDB Server

## Setup
In order to run the game:
1. Clone the repository (download or clone)
2. Open the project directory on a terminal and run the command `` npm install ``

Before starting the game you need to create the database:
1. Start MongoDB Server
2. Create a new Database with the name `` myGame ``
3. Create 2 collections inside called `` account `` and `` progress ``

Now you can return to the project directory and run the command `` node app ``. 
This command will start the game server & client. 
The client is available at the address `` localhost:2000 ``.

You can open multiple `` localhost:2000 `` pages to test also the multiplayer feature!
